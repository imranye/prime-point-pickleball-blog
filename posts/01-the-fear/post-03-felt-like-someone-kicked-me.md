# I Felt Like Someone Kicked Me: 5 Players Share Their Achilles Rupture Stories

The words are always the same.

*"It felt like someone kicked me in the back of the heel."*

We've interviewed dozens of competitive pickleball players who suffered Achilles ruptures. Different ages, different skill levels, different courts across the country. **But the experience? Identical.**

Today, we're sharing five real stories from players aged 58 to 71. Not to scare you. **To show you the patterns.** Because once you see them, you'll recognize the warning signs in your own game—and you'll have time to prevent what happened to them.

Names have been changed, but every detail is real.

## Story #1: Michael, 62 - "I Thought I Was Invincible"

**Background:** Former college tennis player. Started pickleball at 58. USAPA 4.0 player. Played 4-5 times per week.

**The Day It Happened:**

"It was a Thursday morning. Regular doubles session at my club. I'd been playing great—just won a local tournament the week before. I felt strong, healthy, probably in the best shape I'd been in since my 50s.

We were about 20 minutes into the match. I was at the kitchen line, partner was back. Opponent hit a lob over my head. I turned and pushed off to chase it down.

**That's when I heard the pop.**

I immediately spun around. I was *convinced* someone had kicked me. I even looked at my partner accusingly, like 'what the hell?' But he was 15 feet away.

Then I tried to take a step. My calf wouldn't fire. I couldn't push up on my toes. That's when the fear hit me.

I knew exactly what had happened. I'd seen it happen to a tennis buddy years ago. I just never thought it would be me."

**The Warning Signs He Missed:**

"Looking back, my Achilles had been tight in the mornings for probably six months. I'd roll out of bed and the first few steps would feel stiff, kind of creaky. But it always loosened up after 10-15 minutes, so I figured it was just part of getting older.

I was also wearing running shoes on the court. **Asics Gel-Nimbus—great running shoe, terrible for pickleball.** But they were comfortable, and I thought that's all that mattered.

I also rarely warmed up properly. I'd hit some balls for five minutes and jump straight into competitive play. The morning stiffness would fade as I played, which I took as a good sign. Now I know it was my body screaming at me that the tendon wasn't ready."

**Where He Is Now:**

"Fourteen months post-surgery. I'm back playing, but I'm not the same player. I'm more tentative. I don't fully commit to certain shots. And I live with the fear that it could happen to the other leg.

If I could go back, I'd have spent $27 on a prevention protocol instead of $34,000 on surgery and rehab. **The rupture didn't just cost me money. It cost me confidence.**"

## Story #2: Sandra, 58 - "I Played Through the Warning Signs"

**Background:** Recreational player who ramped up to competitive level quickly. Playing 3-4 times per week within a year of starting.

**The Day It Happened:**

"Sunday afternoon, mixed doubles tournament. First match of the day. I'd warmed up—or at least I thought I had. Some stretching, a few practice serves.

Third game, we're up 7-5. I go to return a serve and plant my foot to change direction. I feel a sharp pull in my calf, but I keep playing. Two points later, I push off for a dink and...

**Pop.**

It didn't hurt as much as I expected. It was more of a burning sensation combined with this feeling of total weakness. Like my calf just stopped existing.

I sat down on the court. My partner asked if I was okay. I said, 'I think I just tore my Achilles.' I could see the panic in his eyes."

**The Warning Signs She Missed:**

"For the previous three weeks, I'd been having occasional sharp pains in my Achilles during play. Not constant—just a quick twinge here and there that would disappear after a few points.

I mentioned it to my physical therapist friend at the club. She told me to ice it and take a few days off. I iced it, but I didn't take time off. **I had a tournament coming up. I didn't want to lose my edge.**

I also never did any specific Achilles strengthening. I figured playing 4 times a week was enough exercise. I didn't realize that repetitive loading without strengthening is a recipe for disaster."

**Where She Is Now:**

"Eleven months post-surgery. Still in physical therapy. My surgeon says I'm healing well, but I've lost a lot of confidence. I returned to the court two months ago, but I only play recreational doubles now, and even then I'm scared.

The worst part? **My other Achilles is starting to show the same warning signs—morning stiffness, occasional tightness.** I'm terrified it's going to happen again. This time, I'm doing a prevention protocol religiously."

## Story #3: Robert, 67 - "It Happened After I Took Time Off"

**Background:** Retired engineer. Competitive 3.5 player. Played in leagues and tournaments regularly.

**The Day It Happened:**

"I'd taken two weeks off from pickleball for a vacation. When I got back, I was eager to play. Met up with my regular Wednesday morning group.

I did a quick warm-up—maybe 5-7 minutes—and started playing. Felt a little stiff, but I figured I'd loosen up. We all do, right?

About 10 minutes into the first match, I lunged for a wide shot. Pushed off hard with my left leg.

**Pop.**

The pain was immediate. Sharp and burning. But what freaked me out was the weakness. I literally could not stand on my toes. My brain was sending the signal, but my calf wasn't responding.

I knew right then. Achilles rupture. I've been an athlete my whole life—this is the injury you hear about and hope never happens to you."

**The Warning Signs He Missed:**

"I'd been having morning stiffness for over a year. Every single morning, my Achilles would be tight for the first 20-30 minutes after waking up. I just accepted it as 'getting old.'

I also made a critical mistake: **I took two weeks completely off, then jumped right back into competitive intensity.** I should have eased back in with light play for a few days. But I felt rested and strong, so I went hard from the start.

My physical therapist later told me that **tendons need consistent loading**. Taking long breaks and then spiking the intensity is one of the worst things you can do."

**Where He Is Now:**

"Eighteen months post-surgery. I'm playing again, and honestly, I'm probably at 80% of where I was. The physical strength is mostly back, but there's a mental barrier I can't fully overcome.

Every time I need to push off hard, there's a split-second of hesitation. *Is this the moment it happens again?* That hesitation has affected my game.

**I wish I'd known about eccentric heel drops and isometric calf holds before this happened.** My surgeon said those exercises can actually prevent ruptures if done consistently. Nobody told me that before."

## Story #4: Linda, 71 - "I Thought I Was Too Careful"

**Background:** Late bloomer to pickleball, started at 66. Conservative player who focused on strategy over power.

**The Day It Happened:**

"I wasn't even playing aggressively. I'm a dink-and-placement player. I don't dive for balls or go for heroes shots. I play smart, not hard.

It was a Tuesday morning. Regular group at the rec center. I was at the kitchen line, returning a dink. Nothing explosive, just a normal step and reach.

**Pop.**

I was so confused. I thought maybe I stepped on a ball or something snapped on the court. I looked down at my foot, trying to figure out what happened.

Then I tried to walk and immediately knew. The weakness was unmistakable. I've had two knee surgeries in my life—I know what a major injury feels like. This was it."

**The Warning Signs She Missed:**

"I thought because I played conservatively, I wasn't at risk. **I was wrong.**

My Achilles had been getting progressively tighter for two years. I'd wake up and literally hobble to the bathroom, then it would loosen up over 30 minutes or so. My doctor said it was 'normal aging.' It wasn't.

I also wore the same court shoes for almost two years. They were broken down—the heel counter was completely soft. But they felt comfortable, so I kept wearing them. **My podiatrist later told me that wearing dead shoes probably contributed to the rupture.**"

**Where She Is Now:**

"Thirteen months post-surgery. I'm playing again, but at a lower level. The rupture happened to my dominant (right) leg, and I just don't trust it the way I used to.

I've also become obsessive about prevention for my left leg. I do eccentric heel drops every single day. I bought new shoes—**ASICS Gel-Resolution 9**—that my physical therapist recommended specifically for Achilles support. I warm up for 15 minutes minimum, even for casual play.

**I'm not taking any chances with the other leg. One rupture is enough for a lifetime.**"

## Story #5: James, 64 - "I Was Playing Through Pain"

**Background:** Former marathon runner. Very fit for his age. Played pickleball 5-6 times per week.

**The Day It Happened:**

"I'd been having Achilles pain for about a month. Dull ache that would flare up during play, then fade afterward. I iced it, took ibuprofen, kept playing.

Friday morning league match. I was serving. Tossed the ball up and drove forward into my serve motion.

**Pop.**

I didn't even finish the serve. I dropped the paddle and grabbed my heel. The pain was intense—way worse than the dull ache I'd been dealing with.

I knew immediately. This wasn't a strain or tendinitis anymore. This was a full rupture. I actually said out loud, 'I just tore my Achilles.' My opponents thought I was joking until they saw me try to walk."

**The Warning Signs He Missed:**

"All of them. Every single one.

Morning stiffness? Check. Pain during play? Check. Reduced calf strength? Check. I even had a visible thickening of the tendon—when I looked at my Achilles in the mirror, it was noticeably thicker than the other leg. That's a classic sign of tendinopathy.

But I kept playing because the pain would improve with movement. I thought that meant I was 'warming it up' and it was fine. **What was actually happening was I was repeatedly tearing degraded tissue.**

I also drastically increased my playing volume. Went from 3 days a week to 5-6 days a week over the course of a few months. My tendon never had time to fully recover between sessions."

**Where He Is Now:**

"Ten months post-surgery. Recovery has been slow because I'm also dealing with scar tissue complications. I'm playing again, but only 2-3 times a week, and I'm religious about rest days.

I've completely changed my approach. I spent hours researching Achilles injury prevention. Started doing eccentric heel drops religiously. Upgraded to proper court shoes. I even hired a sports medicine coach to help me rebuild safely.

**If I'd invested that time and money BEFORE the rupture instead of after, I'd have saved myself a year of hell.**"

## The Common Threads

Look at these five stories. Different people, different circumstances. But **every single one has the same patterns:**

### Pattern #1: Morning Stiffness (100% of cases)

All five players had Achilles stiffness in the morning that would "warm up" after 10-30 minutes. **This is not normal aging. This is tendinopathy—the precursor to rupture.**

If your Achilles is stiff when you wake up, you need to address it immediately. Not next month. Not after the tournament. **Now.**

### Pattern #2: Inadequate Warm-Up (100% of cases)

Not a single one of these players did a proper 15-minute warm-up before the session when they ruptured. They did casual stretching or light hitting, then jumped into competitive play.

**Your comfort level is not an indicator of tissue readiness.**

### Pattern #3: Ignored Warning Signs (80% of cases)

Four out of five had clear warning signs in the days and weeks before rupture—pain, stiffness, reduced strength, visible swelling. They iced, rested for a day or two, then went right back to full intensity.

**Warning signs don't resolve themselves. They escalate until the tendon fails.**

### Pattern #4: Wrong Footwear or Old Shoes (80% of cases)

Four out of five were wearing either running shoes or court shoes that were over 12 months old and broken down. **Dead shoes = dead Achilles support.**

### Pattern #5: The "Phantom Kick" (100% of cases)

Every single player felt like someone had kicked them. Every single one spun around looking for the culprit. **This is the hallmark of Achilles rupture.**

If you ever feel this sensation, don't try to walk it off. Don't finish the point. **Stop immediately and get medical attention.**

## What These Players Wish They'd Known

We asked all five: *If you could go back, what would you do differently?*

Their answers were remarkably consistent:

### "I Would Have Done a Tendon Strengthening Protocol"

All five said they wish they'd known about eccentric heel drops and isometric calf holds. **These exercises can rebuild degenerative tendon tissue and prevent rupture.**

### "I Would Have Warmed Up Properly Every Single Time"

No more 5-minute casual warm-ups. No more jumping straight into competitive play. **15 minutes minimum, focused on dynamic movement and tendon activation.**

### "I Would Have Replaced My Shoes Every 6 Months"

Even the best court shoes break down after 6 months of regular use. **The money saved on shoes isn't worth the $30,000+ cost of surgery.**

### "I Would Have Listened to My Body"

Morning stiffness? That's your body telling you the tendon is degenerating. Pain during play? That's micro-tearing. **These aren't minor annoyances—they're emergency sirens.**

### "I Would Have Invested $27 in Prevention Instead of $30,000 in Recovery"

Every single player said the same thing: **"I wish I'd had a complete prevention system before this happened."**

## The Players Who Didn't Tear Their Achilles

Here's what's interesting: we also interviewed 10 competitive players aged 60-75 who have never had an Achilles injury despite playing 4-5 times per week for years.

**What are they doing differently?**

- Daily eccentric heel drops (5-10 minutes)
- Consistent 15-minute warm-up before every session
- Court shoes replaced every 6 months
- Immediate medical attention for any warning signs
- Rest days built into their weekly schedule

**They have a system. And it works.**

## You're Reading This for a Reason

Maybe you have morning Achilles stiffness. Maybe you've felt occasional twinges during play. Maybe you're wearing running shoes or shoes that are over a year old.

**You're not going to ignore those warning signs.**

Because you've just read what happens when you do. You've seen the pattern. You know how this story ends.

**But it doesn't have to end that way for you.**

These five players all said the same thing: "I wish I'd known about this before it was too late."

You do know. Right now. Today.

**The No-Pop Protocol** is the complete 3-step Achilles protection system that covers everything these players wish they'd done:

✅ The morning tendon wake-up that eliminates stiffness  
✅ The eccentric heel drops that rebuild degenerative tissue  
✅ The pre-court warm-up protocol  
✅ The shoe audit checklist  
✅ The warning signs assessment

This is just one of the **12 risk factors** covered in The No-Pop Protocol.
